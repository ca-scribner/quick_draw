# Quick, Draw!

This repo covers a few different uses of Google's Quick, Draw! data.  The dataset is a labeled collection of human sketches of various objects (cats, cows, bats, the Eiffel Tower, ...).  More description is available [here](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data). 

Included in this repo are independent notebooks examining using the Quick, Draw! data using different techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for binary and multi-class classification and using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to simultaneously train a generator that can make realistic(ish) sketches and a discriminator that can tell real from fake.

Note that the GitHub viewer can be pretty awful at rendering .ipynb files.  For better results, paste GitHub link for an .ipynb file into the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
